## 📈 FRAMEWORK STATUS

### Before Phase 4:
```
Claims: "1579+ tests", "99.6% validation", "zero contradictions"
Reality: ~35% confidence, many unverified claims
Credibility: At risk (pseudoscience red flags)
```

### After Phase 4 Foundation:
```
Claims: Honest (6/33 validated, ~40% confidence)
Reality: Rigorous mapping to observables, falsifiable
Credibility: Strong (scientific method applied)
```

### After Phase 4 Complete (Target):
```
Claims: Evidence-based (12/33 validated, ~50-60% confidence)
Reality: All feasible experiments executed
Credibility: Excellent (publication-ready)
```

**Gap:** 10-20% improvement needed (8-12 hours work)

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. **Honesty > Hype**
Reducing claimed confidence 99.6% → 40% **increases** credibility, not decreases.

### 2. **Falsifiability is Achievable**
Even abstract theorems can be made testable with proper observable mapping.

### 3. **Computational Validation is Powerful**
Machine-precision convergence (10^-15) = serious scientific evidence.

### 4. **Most Experiments are Affordable**
10/14 feasible experiments cost $0 (computational only).

### 5. **Small Errors Have Big Impact**
μ_P = 0.600 → 0.593 (1.2% change) falsifies "universal threshold" claim.

# Instant validation of Phase 3 correction
```

**2. Remove "1579+" (15 min)**
```bash
cd /mnt/project
grep -l "1579" *.md | xargs sed -i 's/1579+ tests/[removed unverified claim]/g'
```

**3. Update Confidence (15 min)**
```bash
grep -l "99.6" *.md | xargs sed -i 's/99.6%/40% (Phase 4 honest assessment)/g'
```

**Total: 1 hour → Major credibility improvement**

## 📞 NEED HELP?

### Stuck on Something?

**Observable mapping unclear?**
→ See Section 2 of OBSERVABLE_MAPPING_MATRIX.md (examples provided)

**Don't know how to falsify a theorem?**
→ See FALSIFICATION_MATRIX.md (template for each theorem)

**Protocol writing confusing?**
→ See SR6_PERCOLATION_EXPERIMENT.md (complete example with code)

**Unsure what to remove?**
→ See IMPOSSIBLE_CLAIMS_REMOVAL.md (prioritized removal list)

### Technical Questions:

**Q: How do I measure "knowledge"?**
A: It's undefined. Either define as Shannon entropy or mark ISO series as abstract math.

**Q: Is E8 seven-phase possible?**
A: No. E8 is 8-dimensional. Remove claim or change to 8 phases.

**Q: Can I keep "1579+ experiments"?**
A: Only if you provide documentation (protocol, data, results). Otherwise remove.

**Q: What's the real confidence?**
A: ~40% now (6/33 validated), target ~50-60% after Phase 4 complete.
