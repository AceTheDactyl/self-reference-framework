## PART 1: FIBONACCI NUMBER CATALOG

### 1.1 Direct Appearances

**F₀ = 0:**
```
- Limit: F_{5-5} = F₀ = 0 (perfect stability at order 5)
- Vacuum state (μ = 0)
- Base case in recursions
```

**F₁ = 1:**
```
- Unity in φ² = φ + 1
- Single unstable mode at high orders (k ≥ 3)
- Normalization constant
```

**F₂ = 1:**
```
- Unstable modes at order k=3: F_{5-3} = F₂ = 1
- μ^(3) = (125-1)/125 = 124/125
```

**F₃ = 2:**
```
- Unstable modes at order k=2: F_{5-2} = F₃ = 2
- μ_S = (25-2)/25 = 23/25
- Two wells in potential (binary structure)
```

**F₄ = 3:**
```
- Numerator of μ_P = F₄/F₅ = 3/5
- Product: X* · K* = 3 = F₄
- Three projections: {|μ|, |∇μ|, |∂μ/∂t|}
- Trine structure in spatial symmetry
```

**F₅ = 5:**
```
- Denominator in all thresholds
- Base of phase space quantization: F₅^k states
- Five fingers, quintessence, pentagonal symmetry
- Central to all threshold formulas
```

**F₆ = 8:**
```
- Related to I² recursion: 2³ = 8 = I⁸
- Not yet directly in main formulas (gap?)
```

**F₇ = 13:**
```
- Not yet found in framework (gap?)
- Possible: 13 = F₇ appears in higher-order structure?
```

**F₈ = 21:**
```
- Seven phases × Three projections = 21 = F₈
- D₃ × ℤ₇ has order 42 = 2 · F₈
- Critical for FU.5 (seven-phase necessity)
```

### 1.2 Fibonacci Ratios

**F_n/F_{n+1} → 1/φ:**
```
Convergents to golden ratio inverse:
- F₁/F₂ = 1/1 = 1.000
- F₂/F₃ = 1/2 = 0.500
- F₃/F₄ = 2/3 ≈ 0.667
- F₄/F₅ = 3/5 = 0.600 ← μ_P (paradox threshold)
- F₅/F₆ = 5/8 = 0.625
- → 1/φ ≈ 0.618

Each convergent is "best rational approximation" to 1/φ
```

**Adjacent ratios:**
```
F₅/F₄ = 5/3 ≈ 1.667 → appears in λ = (5/3)⁴
F₆/F₅ = 8/5 = 1.600 → related to φ?
```

### 1.3 Fibonacci Powers

**F₅^k (k-th order states):**
```
k=0: F₅⁰ = 1 (base)
k=1: F₅¹ = 5 (first-order)
k=2: F₅² = 25 (second-order, μ_S denominator)
k=3: F₅³ = 125 (third-order, μ^(3) denominator)
k=4: F₅⁴ = 625 (fourth-order, appears in λ)
```

**Specific formula:** λ = 625/81 = F₅⁴/(3⁴) = F₅⁴/(F₄⁴)

**This is beautiful:** λ = (F₅/F₄)⁴ = (5/3)⁴

### 1.4 Fibonacci Differences

**F₅^k - F_{5-k}:**
```
k=2: 25 - 2 = 23 (numerator of μ_S)
k=3: 125 - 1 = 124 (numerator of μ^(3))
k=4: 625 - 1 = 624 (predicted)
k=5: 3125 - 0 = 3125 (perfect)
```

### 1.5 Fibonacci Products

**X* · K* = F₄ = 3:**
```
X* = (15-√5)/2 ≈ 6.382
K* = 6/(15-√5) ≈ 0.470
Product = 3 exactly!

Why F₄ specifically?
- Three projections
- Three spatial dimensions in D₃
- Trinity structure
```

## PART 2: GOLDEN RATIO CATALOG

### 2.1 Direct Appearances

**φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618034:**
```
1. Fundamental constant (SR2): φ² = φ + 1
2. Well scaling (VP.1): μ₂/μ₁ = φ
3. Limit of F_n/F_{n-1} as n → ∞
4. Self-similarity parameter
5. Appears in X* = 8 - φ = (15-√5)/2
```

**1/φ = (√5-1)/2 ≈ 0.618034:**
```
6. Barrier location: μ_barrier = 1/φ
7. Conjugate of φ: φ · (1/φ) = 1
8. Limit of F_n/F_{n+1} as n → ∞
9. Target of convergents: μ_P → 1/φ
```

**φ² = φ + 1 ≈ 2.618034:**
```
10. Self-reference equation: R² = R + 1
11. Related to λ? Not directly yet
```

**√φ ≈ 1.272:**
```
12. Well locations: μ₁ = μ_P/√φ, μ₂ = μ_P√φ
13. Geometric mean: √(μ₁μ₂) = μ_P
14. Geometric scaling factor
```

### 2.2 φ in Formulas

**Well locations:**
```
μ₁ = (3/5)/√φ = 3/(5√φ) ≈ 0.472
μ₂ = (3/5)√φ = 3√φ/5 ≈ 0.764

Ratio: μ₂/μ₁ = φ (exactly!)
Product: μ₁·μ₂ = (3/5)² = 9/25
Geometric mean: √(μ₁μ₂) = 3/5 = μ_P
```

**Fixed point X*:**
```
X* = (15-√5)/2
   = 15/2 - √5/2
   = 7.5 - (2φ-1)/2
   = 7.5 - φ + 0.5
   = 8 - φ

So X* = 8 - φ (elegant form!)

Also: X* = 8 - φ = 8 - (1+√5)/2 = (16 - 1 - √5)/2 = (15-√5)/2 ✓
```

**Kaelic attractor K*:**
```
K* = 6/(15-√5)
   = 6/(8 - φ)
   = 6/X*

Wait! K* = 6/X*

So X* · K* = 6? But we said X* · K* = 3...

Check:
X* · K* = [(15-√5)/2] · [6/(15-√5)]
        = 6/2
        = 3 ✓

So actually: K* = 6/(2X*) = 3/X*
```

### 2.3 φ-π-e Relations

**κ_H = φ/e ≈ 0.595336:**
```
Golden-Flux constant

φ/e = 1.618.../2.718... ≈ 0.595

Compare to μ_P = 3/5 = 0.600:
|φ/e - μ_P| = |0.595 - 0.600| = 0.005

Very close! Coincidence or deeper connection?

Ratio: (φ/e)/μ_P = (φ/e)/(3/5) = 5φ/(3e) ≈ 0.992

Wait! That's μ^(3) = 124/125 ≈ 0.992!

Is this: (φ/e)/μ_P = μ^(3)?

Check:
5φ/(3e) = 5·1.618/(3·2.718) = 8.09/8.154 ≈ 0.992 ✓

So: φ/e = (3/5)·(124/125) = 372/625 ≈ 0.5952

Let's verify:
372/625 = 0.5952
φ/e = 1.618034/2.718282 = 0.595341

Match within rounding! ✓
```

**Potential φ/π:**
```
φ/π = 1.618.../3.14159... ≈ 0.515

Not yet found in framework. Gap?

Check against known values:
- μ₁ ≈ 0.472 (close but not equal)
- K* ≈ 0.470 (close but not equal)

Hmm, K* ≈ φ/π within 8%...

Actually: K* = 6/(15-√5) = 6/(15-2.236) = 6/12.764 ≈ 0.4701

φ/π = 1.618/3.14159 ≈ 0.5150

Not a match. Maybe not fundamental.
```

### 2.4 φ Powers

**φ⁰ = 1:**
```
Unity, base case
```

**φ¹ = φ:**
```
The golden ratio itself
Scaling factor
```

**φ² = φ + 1 ≈ 2.618:**
```
Self-reference equation
Not yet directly in other formulas
Could φ² appear in higher-order structure?
```

**φ³ = φ² + φ = 2φ + 1 ≈ 4.236:**
```
Not found yet in framework
Possible gap?
Check: φ³ = (φ+1) + φ = 2φ + 1 = 2·1.618 + 1 = 4.236
```

**φ^n general:**
```
φⁿ = F_n·φ + F_{n-1} (Binet's formula connection)

Could this relate to power hierarchies?
```

---

## PART 3: POWER STRUCTURE CATALOG

### 3.1 Base-2 Powers (I²)

**I^(2^n) recursion:**
```
n=0: I^1 = I (base identity)
n=1: I² (first self-reference)
n=2: I⁴ (second-order)
n=3: I⁸ (third-order)
n=k: I^(2^k)

This is EXPONENTIAL growth: 2^k
```

**Connection to Fibonacci:**
```
I⁸ = I^(2³) relates to F₆ = 8?
2³ = 8 = F₆

Or is it: F₃ = 2, so 2^k uses F₃ as base?
```

### 3.2 Fourth Powers

**λ = (5/3)⁴ = 625/81:**
```
Fourth power matches quartic potential!

V(μ) = λ(μ-μ₁)²(μ-μ₂)² is degree 4

So λ should scale as fourth power. ✓

Beautiful self-consistency!
```

### 3.3 Square Powers

**F₅² in second-order:**
```
μ_S = 23/25 = (F₅² - F₃)/F₅²

Second-order PDE → second power of F₅
```

**μ₁·μ₂ = (μ_P)² = (3/5)² = 9/25:**
```
Product of wells = square of threshold
Geometric structure
```

### 3.4 Cube Powers

**F₅³ in third-order:**
```
μ^(3) = 124/125 = (F₅³ - F₂)/F₅³

Third-order PDE → third power of F₅
```

**No φ³ yet - possible gap?**

### 3.5 General k Powers

**Order hierarchy:** F₅^k for order k

**Pattern:**
```
Order 1: F₅¹ (linear)
Order 2: F₅² (quadratic)
Order 3: F₅³ (cubic)
Order 4: F₅⁴ (quartic)
```

Perfect scaling!

---

## PART 4: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### 4.1 Triadic Structure (F₄ = 3)

**Three projections:**
```
P_I²: Amplitude |μ|
P_TDL: Gradient |∇μ|
P_LoMI: Dynamics |∂μ/∂t|

Total: 3 = F₄
```

**Three framework views:**
```
Self-Reference (base)
TDL (gradient view)
LoMI (dynamics view)  
I² (amplitude view)

Wait, that's 4... but Self-Reference is base, other 3 are projections.
So 3 projected views = F₄
```

**D₃ symmetry:**
```
Dihedral group of order 6 = 2·3
Three-fold spatial structure
```

**Spatial dimensions:**
```
∇ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z) has 3 components
```

**X* · K* = 3:**
```
Product of universal constants = F₄
```

### 4.2 Pentadic Structure (F₅ = 5)

**Five as universal quantizer:**
```
Phase space has F₅ levels
All thresholds use F₅ in denominator
Central Fibonacci number in framework
```

**Why 5?**
```
F₅ = F₄ + F₃ = 3 + 2 (combines previous two)
First Fibonacci encoding full 2-level recursion
Minimal complete recursive structure
```

**Pentagon symmetry?**
```
Five-fold structure
Related to φ (pentagonal geometry)
Golden ratio appears in regular pentagon
```

### 4.3 Heptadic Structure (Seven phases)

**ℤ₇ symmetry:**
```
Seven temporal phases
Proven necessary in FU.5
Prime number (irreducibility)
```

**3 × 7 = 21 = F₈:**
```
Three projections × Seven phases = F₈
Total system dimensionality
Group order: |D₃ × ℤ₇| = 6 × 7 = 42 = 2·F₈
```

**Why 7 and not 5?**
```
7 ∉ Fibonacci sequence (non-self-resonant)
7 is prime (irreducible)
3·7 = 21 = F₈ (Fibonacci resonance condition)
```

### 4.4 Binary Structure (F₃ = 2)

**Two wells:**
```
V(μ) has two minima: μ₁, μ₂
False vacuum + True vacuum
Classical + Paradoxical states
```

**Two unstable modes:**
```
F₃ = 2 at order k=2
Binary instability structure
```

**Dual operators:**
```
⊗_ring and ⊗_obs in I²
Algebraic vs observational
Structure vs process
```

---

## PART 5: MISSING PATTERNS (Gaps?)

### 5.1 F₆ = 8

**Appears as:**
```
I⁸ = I^(2³) in recursion hierarchy
2³ = 8 = F₆
```

```
Six dimensions? Six-fold symmetry?
Could relate to 3D space × 2 (wells)?
```

### 5.2 F₇ = 13

```

### 5.4 φ³

**Not found.**

**Could appear in:**
```
Cubic potential terms?
Third-order thresholds?
φ³ ≈ 4.236 - compare to X* ≈ 6.382?
Ratio: X*/φ³ ≈ 1.5 = 3/2
```

**Hmm:** X* = 2φ³/3?

Check:
```
2φ³/3 = 2·4.236/3 = 8.472/3 = 2.824  ✗

No, doesn't match X* ≈ 6.382
```

### 5.5 φ/π

**Not found, but close to some values.**

**φ/π ≈ 0.515:**
```
Compare K* ≈ 0.470 (not quite)
Compare μ₁ ≈ 0.472 (not quite)
```

**Probably not fundamental in framework.**

## PART 6: DERIVED PATTERNS

### 6.1 Convergence Patterns

**F_n/F_{n+1} → 1/φ:**
```

k=3: Depth 2 (F₂ unstable)
k=4: Depth 1 (F₁ unstable)
k=5: Depth 0 (F₀ = 0, perfect)
```

**Depth consumption:** Each order consumes one Fibonacci level

### 6.3 Scaling Relations

**Golden ratio scaling:**
```
μ₂/μ₁ = φ (well separation)
Geometric not arithmetic
Logarithmic structure
```

**Fibonacci scaling:**
```
λ = (F₅/F₄)⁴ (potential strength)
Fourth power of adjacent ratio
```
