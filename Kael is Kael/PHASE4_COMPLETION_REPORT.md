## DELIVERABLES COMPLETED

### 1. UNVERIFIED_CLAIMS_AUDIT.md (2,500 words)

**Critical Findings:**
- "[removed unverified claim]" → NO DOCUMENTATION (remove all references)
- "~50% confidence (13/33 theorems validated, Phase 1-5)" → INFLATED (actual: ~40-50%)
- "major contradictions resolved (Phases 2-4)" → FALSE (15+ contradictions identified)
- Multiple threshold claims without protocols

**Impact:** HIGH - Exposes scientific integrity issues

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, ready for implementation

### 3. IMPOSSIBLE_CLAIMS_REMOVAL.md (5,000 words)

**Categorized 17 Claims:**

**Physically Impossible (5):**
1. seven degrees of freedom in configuration space (not 7D physical space) (exceeds 3+1 spacetime)
2. seven degrees of freedom (not [E8 reference removed - claim was mathematically inconsistent] - E8 is 8-dimensional) structure (E8 is 8D, not 7D)
3. model-specific critical points (e.g., 2D percolation: p_c ≈ 0.593) (different models → different thresholds)
4. Perpetual coherence (violates thermodynamics)
5. Instantaneous propagation (violates causality)

**Mathematically Inconsistent (4):**
1. X* = 6.382 equation (algebra fails: 6.382 ≠ 2.585)
2. μ^(k) formula (fails for k<2)
3. K* = 8.854 calculation (numerical error)
4. SR7 vs 4P contradiction (three vs four projections)

**Unfalsifiable (5):**
1. "Knowledge" without operational definition
2. "Coherence" without quantification
3. "Meta-information" undefined
4. "Recursion depth" I^(2^n) abstract
5. μ_S = 0.920 without derivation

**Empirically Falsified (3):**
1. "[removed unverified claim]" (unverified)
2. "~50% confidence (13/33 theorems validated, Phase 1-5)" (inflated)
3. "major contradictions resolved (Phases 2-4)" (false)

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Framework Overclaims Validation

**Evidence:**
- Claims: "[removed unverified claim]", "~50% confidence (13/33 theorems validated, Phase 1-5)"
- Reality: 6/33 validated (18%), ~40-50% confidence
- **Gap:** 2-3× overestimate

**Recommendation:** Immediate correction to honest metrics

---

### 2. Universal Threshold Claim Falsified

**Evidence:**
- Claimed: μ_P varies by model (2D percolation: p_c = 0.593)
- Reality: Model-specific (percolation p_c = 0.593, Ising T_c/J = 2.269, etc.)
- **Status:** Already corrected in Phase 3

**Recommendation:** Update all documentation to remove "universal" claim

---

### 3. Measurability Gap

**Statistics:**
- Measurable: 14/33 (42%)
- Computational only: 5/33 (15%)
- Undefined: 4/33 (12%)
- **Gap:** 31% of theorems lack physical interpretation

**Recommendation:** Define abstract constructs (knowledge, recursion) or mark as pure math

---

### 4. E8 Mathematical Error

**Error:** Claiming 7-phase structure from 8-dimensional [E8 reference removed - claim was mathematically inconsistent]

**Impact:** Undermines credibility of framework

**Recommendation:** Remove all E8 references or correct to 8-fold symmetry

---

### 5. Strong Computational Foundation

**Achievement:** 6 theorems validated with rigorous simulations

**Quality:**
- Energy conservation <2%
- Machine precision convergence (10^-15)
- Reproducible (seeded RNG)
- Falsifiable (explicit criteria)

**Recommendation:** Build on this success - extend to remaining theorems

---
