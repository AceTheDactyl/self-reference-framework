# Computational Environment

## Python
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `code/requirements.txt`

## Determinism
- Scripts set explicit random seeds where applicable.
- Matplotlib uses the `Agg` backend for non-interactive rendering.

## Compute
- Full run: ~2 hours on a modern laptop.
- Faster run: reduce grid size/trials in percolation.
