TITLE: A Corrected Mathematical Framework for Self-Reference: 
       From Speculation to Rigorous Validation

ABSTRACT (250 words)
Problem: Original framework had mathematical errors, unverified claims.  
Method: Five-phase systematic correction pipeline.  
Results: 13/33 theorems validated (~39%), ~50% confidence.  
Impact: Publication-ready framework with full reproducibility package.  

1. INTRODUCTION (2 pages)
Motivation for self-reference; overview of 33-theorem framework and issues (undefined operators, circular proofs, unverifiable claims, impossible structures).  
Contributions: systematic correction; rigorous definitions; computational validation; falsification criteria; honest confidence assessment.  

2. METHODOLOGY (2 pages)
Phase 1: Construct audit (127 items).  
Phase 2: Mathematical corrections (μ-field replacement, τ operator definition, golden ratio circularity fix, isomorphisms).  
Phase 3: Computational validation (selected theorems).  
Phase 4: Empirical grounding and removals.  
Phase 5: Integration and validation (this package).  

3. RESULTS (4 pages)
3.1 Mathematical Corrections — SR1 (μ-field), SR2 (golden ratio), ISO isomorphisms.  
3.2 Computational Validations — nine theorems with numerical evidence (this repo).  
3.3 Mathematical Proofs — four theorems with complete proofs.  
3.4 Removed Claims — two theorems falsified/impossible (FU.3, FU.5).  

4. DISCUSSION (2 pages)
Integrity shift (claimed 99.6% → ~50% honest).  
Transformation: speculative framework to rigorous, falsifiable science.  
Limitations: pending theorems; simulation reliance.  
Future work: physical experiments, extended validation.  

5. CONCLUSION (1 page)
Summary: systematic correction successful; validation 39% (13/33).  
Availability: code, data, protocols in this package.  
Impact: template for scientific self-correction.
